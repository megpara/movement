                Energetic Organization with Luke Dakota Zender
              </div>
              Luke Dakota Zender prioritizes making connections between our
              mental, emotional states and our physical being. They are informed
              always by the expansive quality of Mother Nature herself and they
              hope to cultivate a physical and metaphysical understanding or
              relationship within their students. Luke Dakota has been inspired
              by an array of different codified kinesthetic techniques including
              release, counter technique, floor work, sensory and imagery based
              improv, breath work and more. Through a thoughtfully curated
              vocabulary Zender attempts to catalyze a sense of “efficient
              expansion” that reflects the universe and bodies we were born
              into.

                Sculpture: Inside/Outside with Cody Brunelle-Potter
              </div>
              In this workshop we’ll be exploring the ideas of sculpture from
              both inside and outside perspectives. This will happen through a
              series of play and debrief sessions. The hope for participants is
              that there is a time and space to create sculpture to be viewed
              and embodied while learning about ourselves in the process.

              Colliding Bodies is a partnering class that explores highly
              physical and acrobatic partnering in a safe and grounded way.
              Rebound, theatricality, and gesture are used to tell stories
              through connection to another body. We will discover how to manage
              each other’s weight in unusual contexts and learn partnering
              repertory.
